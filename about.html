  <h1>(*insert adjective*) design is everywhere...</h1>
  <p>What's your adjective? There's a number of them for me: bad, outdated, insulting, unimaginative, boring, tired...I could go on, and while many of those are true, there's also some real design genius at work all around us that goes unappreciated everyday. Design that is so good, we don't even think about it. Dezynerd's mission is to draw attention to that sort of design in the world - the kind so rarely experienced, because your brain doesn't even process it as something to experience. It just works. We love that stuff.</p>
  
  <p>We really hate the other kind of design. The kind we are forced to experience day in and day out with no alternative to its brazen mockery of human psychology, physiology, existing design patterns, component materials, or environmental cues.  The kind that is so terrible and so awful, that we are compelled to write about it if only to share our despair and agony with others.  Also - hopefully - spur into action a conversation about how to make it better. Occasionally, we may rally the community in a good old public mocking, if we're feeling particularly disgusted with a poor piece of design.</p>
  
  <p>There will be some rants written - feel free to skip them. There will be some lines drawn - feel free to cross them. There may even be a pie chart at some point - feel free to mock it openly. I'm trying to set your expectations: Dezynerd will <strong>never</strong> be one of the many feely-goody designer sites your friends all link to on their whatever accounts. We'll never use the word "delightful" un-ironically, or write a disertation on which hue of purple looks good blah blah whatever, I'm partially color blind so I outsource those decisions to people who can see the whole spectrum and why would you click on an article about hues of purple anyways?</p>
  
  <p>Back to the point: Our goal is to highlight the design that fades into the background; that is so perfect and unobtrusive, that it is invisible to most who come into contact with it. We hope you'll stay a minute, read a few articles, and always and please feel free to suggest topics (or offer to write a guest post!). The best design is done in collaboration with others, after all.</p>
  
  <p>Welcome to Dezynerd, my fellow design nerds.</p>
