Q: What is the primary purpose of Dezynerd?
A: To inform visitors on some aspect, implementation, technique, or showcase of design (or lack thereof). Primary method of informing
readers will be via written articles, with occasional pictures/audio/vidio posts as supporting documents.

Q: Who is the primary audience? Secondary audience?
A: I would like the primary audience to be design "newbies" - those people that maybe don't know a lot about 
design yet, but they are curious and passionnate and are looking for alternative sources to learn about design
that aren't too artsy-fartsy - more down to earth and explanatory, and useful. Secondary audience would be serious
designers that are more "plain-speak" about design, and not so stuck up.

Q: How will you reach your primary audience?
A: I want to write about design specific topics that go ignored or under-explained. Everyone writes design articles
on fonts and typography and color theory etc. I want to write articles about the decisions (or lack thereof) that go into
design, and why there are tradeoffs in design, what are the influences of specific examples of design, etc.  For instance:
who designs freeway medians?  Are they truly designed, or just "engineered"? Are there conflicts that exist between the two?
My hope is that these frank, plain-speak articles will attract more pragmatic audiences of newbie designers, and fill a gap
that I think exists in the design community to understand and learn about these things.

Q: How will you reach your secondary audience?
A: My hope is that the articles I write will be different enough from what's being published in mainstream design blogs that
it will attract experienced designers who can relate to my voice, perspective, and design world-view and want to contribute
articles/ideas of their own. 

Q: What will the site structure look like?
A: Unknown right now. The primary purpose will be to deliver article-style content, so I might start with a simple WordPress blog.
and see how that goes.
